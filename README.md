# Maze Maker Demo

**NOTE: This is a small demo program written
for a past school assignment while learning how
to code in C++**

This program assembles two kinds of mazes and
describes in detail what is in the two mazes
that are based off of two pre-defined themes.

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate
the use of the factory method of creating software
in C++ and how to create a program using this
design pattern.
